7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan is a small Network Block Device server
library for Common Lisp. It has no special aims except producing
nerdgasms, and maybe realizing a few ideas regarding my other
deduplication projects.

Due to laziness it does not have an asdf-package yet. It requires
usocket.

The API is simple and self-explanatory:

(start-single-server port size read-callback write-callback)

starts a server, where you need to provide the port, the size of the
block device, and two callback functions. An example server, creating
a block device on a LISP vector, is given in the function run-rampool
- BEWARE that this returns the whole ram block device as an array - SO
SET *PRINT-LENGTH* APPROPRIATE!
